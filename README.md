# GitHub Open Source Mentorships

GitHub is the world's largest code repository and home to countless open source projects, including many that we actively contribute to. We also participate in several open source mentorship programs.

If you are looking for an opportunity to work on an open source project with a GitHub member, please look through the [project idea list][project] and apply through one of the [available programs][program]. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/github/mentorships/labels/question) to ask questions or discuss other ideas.
