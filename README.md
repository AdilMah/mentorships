# Google Summer of Code

GitHub is the world's largest code repository and home to countless open source projects, including many that we actively participate in.

These ideas are suggestions that we think would make good Google Summer of Code projects. They are only meant to be a starting point. Check out our [proposal template](proposal-template.md), and feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/github/gsoc/issues/new) to ask questions or discuss other ideas.
